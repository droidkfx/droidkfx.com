        Hi, this website uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">HTML web
        components</a> to do its thing. You must enable javascript to explore here. If you are not comfortable with that
        no hard feelings. I would offer an alternative to my LinkedIn but that site will also stop working if you don't
        have js enabled. You will find it hard to find a website that doesn't require js these days.
    </p>

        If you are still interested in seeing my work you check out my resume as a PDF <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>
